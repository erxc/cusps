This repository contains R code for principal stratification with U-statistics under principal ignorability.

Three scenarios are considered: 1. the estimand is a Mann-Whitney probabilistic index; 2. the estimand is a win ratio; and 3. a sensitivity analysis for the monotonicity assumption when the estimand is a win ratio.

Five methods are compared, including three moment-type estiamtors, a triply robust estimator, and a debiased/double machine learning estimator.
